# VirtualMarketPlace
This repository contains all the files of a website created for a software simulation based event in my college. The website works as a Virtual Marketplace like Amazon or Flipkart, where customers can buy and sell components on the market. The components on the website are different electronics components.

I have also uploaded the screenshots of the website in the repository. Feel free to go through them
